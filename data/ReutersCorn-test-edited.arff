'ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT Mounting trade friction between the U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia s exporting nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic damage, businessmen and officials said.     They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S. Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.     But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo s loss might be their gain.     The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in retaliation for Japan s alleged failure to stick to a pact not to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.     Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the new taxes.      "We wouldn t be able to do business, " said a spokesman for leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>.      "If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S., " said Tom Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;James Capel and Co>.     In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.      "We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against Japan because it serves as a warning to us, " said a senior Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.     Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.     The surplus helped swell Taiwan s foreign exchange reserves to 53 billion dlrs, among the world s largest.      "We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation, " said Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>.     A senior official of South Korea s trade promotion association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports are similar to those of Japan.     Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.     In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the U.S.     In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by further U.S. Pressure to block imports.      "That is a very short-term view, " said Lawrence Mills, director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.      "If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong is the disadvantage of action restraining trade, " he said.     The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong s biggest export market, accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.     The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern, Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.      "This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very serious matter, " Button said.     He said Australia s concerns centred on coal and beef, Australia s two largest exports to Japan and also significant U.S. Exports to that country.     Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the trade stand-off continue.     Japan s ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.     The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget and record public works spending in the first half of the financial year.     They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone s avowed fiscal reform program.     Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto Kuroda, Japan s deputy minister of International Trade and Industry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an effort to end the dispute.

'CHINA DAILY SAYS VERMIN EAT 7-12 PCT GRAIN STOCKS A survey of 19 provinces and seven cities showed vermin consume between seven and 12 pct of China s grain stocks, the China Daily said.     It also said that each year 1.575 mln tonnes, or 25 pct, of China s fruit output are left to rot, and 2.1 mln tonnes, or up to 30 pct, of its vegetables. The paper blamed the waste on inadequate storage and bad preservation methods.     It said the government had launched a national programme to reduce waste, calling for improved technology in storage and preservation, and greater production of additives.

'JAPAN TO REVISE LONG-TERM ENERGY DEMAND DOWNWARDS The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese energy demand, ministry officials said.     MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600 mln, they said.     The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen and a decline in domestic electric power demand.     MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.     They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.     Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan s electric power in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27 pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.

'THAI TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN FIRST QUARTER Thailand s trade deficit widened to 4.5 billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a year ago, the Business Economics Department said.     It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht from 58.7 billion. Thailand s improved business climate this year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials and semi-finished products.     The country s oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the first quarter due to lower oil prices.     The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6 billion baht from 56.6 billion.     Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower earnings from many key commodities including rice whose earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26 pct and canned pineapples seven pct.     Products registering high export growth were jewellery up 64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.  REUTER &#3;',1
'INDONESIA SEES CPO PRICE RISING SHARPLY Indonesia expects crude palm oil (CPO) prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne FOB sometime this year because of better European demand and a fall in Malaysian output, Hasrul Harahap, junior minister for tree crops, told Indonesian reporters.     Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332 dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said.     Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despite making recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that it could possibly increase its international market share.     Indonesia, the world s second largest producer of palm oil after Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure supplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.     Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary shortage than to lose export markets.     Indonesian exports of CPO in calendar 1986 were 530,500 tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bank figures.  REUTER &#3;',0
'AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN SHIP BAN ENDS BUT NSW PORTS HIT Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW), Victoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban on foreign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are still being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.     The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.     The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration Commission today.     Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.     The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to protest changes to the state s workers  compensation laws.     The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of each shift and then to walk off.     Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with container movements most affected, but has not stopped altogether, they said.     They said they could not say how long the disruption will go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements.  REUTER &#3;',0
'INDONESIAN COMMODITY EXCHANGE MAY EXPAND The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian Nainggolan said.     He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.     Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil may also be introduced. But he said the question was still being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no decision on when to go ahead had been made.     The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.      "Several factors make us move cautiously, " Nainggolan said.  "We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange. "     Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward, exchange officials said.     The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one official said a feasibility study was needed first. No decisions are likely until after Indonesia s elections on April 23, traders said.     Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the world s second largest producer of natural rubber, should expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of the exchange would help this.     Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.     He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to encourage participation.     Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start although trading in coffee has been disappointing.     Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9 mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered locally, the latest exchange report said.      Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905 tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah.      Total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and 44 traders.  REUTER &#3;',0

'SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> is certain to lose its status as Japan s most profitable bank as a result of its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.     Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9 trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in October.     But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its position.      "We ll be back in position in first place within three years, " Komatsu said in an interview.     He said that while the merger will initially reduce Sumitomo s profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand Sumitomo s branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where it has been relatively weak.     But financial analysts are divided on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off.     Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in view of the smaller bank s large debts. Others argue the merger was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch network from scratch.     The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the wisdom of some of those moves.      "They ve made bold moves to put everything in place. Now it s largely out of their hands, " said Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson.     Among Sumitomo s problems are limits placed on its move to enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.     Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5 pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.      "The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected, " said one analyst.     But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.      "U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so, we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three years, not until the 21st century, " Komatsu said.     Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes into the securities business at home.     Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan s version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial from investment banking.     But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu said he hopes further deregulation will create new opportunities.      "We need to find new business chances, " Komatsu said.  "In some cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust bank related. That s the kind of deregulation we want. "     Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such domestic securities business as profitable government bond dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.     He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.      The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon, following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.     But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.      "We don t want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed in two or three years, " he said.     Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.     The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.      "It s (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies, " said Kleinwort s Smithson.      "After that, it s a question of absorbing and juggling around. It will be the next decade before we see if the strategy is right or wrong. "  REUTER &#3;',0

'BUNDESBANK ALLOCATES 6.1 BILLION MARKS IN TENDER The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1 billion marks at today s tender for a 28-day securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman said.     Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy back securities pledged on May 6.     Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with today s allocation.     A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful liquidity in the banking system.     Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.     The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2 billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.     Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main open-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Two further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.     The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6 and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that range are possible, dealers said.  REUTER &#3;',0
'BOND CORP STILL CONSIDERING ATLAS MINING BAIL-OUT Bond Corp Holdings Ltd &lt;BONA.S> and Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corp &lt;ATLC.MN> are still holding talks on a bail-out package for the troubled mining firm, an Atlas statement said.     Atlas, the Philippines  biggest copper producer, said it had been hit by depressed world copper prices. It reported a net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986, compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985.     The company said it had been able to cut its losses because its scaled-down copper operations in the central island of Cebu started in the second half of 1986.     Atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisition by Bond of the company s existing bank loans and their restructuring into a gold loan.     A memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in October last year said Bond would acquire Atlas  total loans of 275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold.     Atlas said the two sides were also discussing equity infusion into Atlas and the creation of a development fund for further exploration and development of the company s gold properties in the central province of Masbate.     Wilson Banks, general manager of &lt;Bond Corp International Ltd> in Hong Kong, told Reuters the Atlas statement on the negotiations was  "reasonably accurate. "     Banks said Bond Corp was seriously considering several investments in the Philippines but did not give details.     In its statement, Atlas said development of the pre-World War Two underground mines in Masbate had been accelerated and the ore tonnage had increased, extending the operation s life at least until 1993.

'JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S. Japan s Agriculture Ministry, angered by U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan, a senior ministry official said.      "Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives by other suppliers, " the official, who declined to be named, said.  "Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise its farm import market, " he said.     Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S. Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers.     Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said. End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.     U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.     Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next March 31.     Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.     U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.     An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S. Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business.     The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices, purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts, prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.     To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan s top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products.     But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector.      "Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these issues should not be discussed on the same table, " the official said.  REUTER &#3;',1

'SOUTH KOREA MOVES TO SLOW GROWTH OF TRADE SURPLUS South Korea s trade surplus is growing too fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it down, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.     He told a press conference the government planned to increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold the surplus  "at a proper level. "     But he said the government would not allow the won to appreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea has been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.     The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with the U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.     Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects were bright for the South Korean economy, but the government would try to hold the current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next five years.      "Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But now the surplus is growing faster than we expected, " he said.     Trade ministry officials said South Korea s exports rose 35 pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.     Kim said the swing of South Korea s current account to a surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr deficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first time.     South Korea s foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest in Asia.      "This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the major constraints on our development... Last year was a major turning point for the Korean economy, " Kim said.     Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of foreign debt to the country s GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from about 50 pct in 1986.      "The government, however, does not want to accelerate reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus, " he said.     Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation and lead to trade friction with Seoul s major trading partners, particularly the United States.      "We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a proper level, " Kim said.  REUTER &#3;',0
'FINNS AND CANADIANS TO STUDY MTBE PRODUCTION PLANT Finland s national oil company Neste Oy &lt;NEOY.HE> said in a statement it had agreed with Canadian firms to study the feasibility of building a plant in Edmonton, Canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.     The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mln Canadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said.     The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese Canada Inc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe Line Company Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.     The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the important capital and operating advantages gained by locating on an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.     The partners would look into the feasibility of a plant producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancer that can replace tetra ethyl lead.     Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United States where lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because of health concerns, the statement added.     Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as the U.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination in Canada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE, it said.     Finland s Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over five billion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has a major investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.     The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go on stream in late 1989, the statement said.  REUTER &#3;',0

'CITIBANK NORWAY UNIT LOSES SIX MLN CROWNS IN 1986 Citibank A/S &lt;CCI.N>, the Norwegian subsidiary of the U.S.-based bank, said it made a net loss of just over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankers said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years.     Citibank s Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told Reuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic slump in Norway following last year s plunge in oil prices.     Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in Norway since 1985.     Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway s second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would make profit this year.     Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.     Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank s &lt;CMB.N> subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavy losses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking.  REUTER &#3;',0

'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING Australian markets are booming as foreign fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and other traditional markets, analysts said.     High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of fresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and U.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.     Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in and have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.     A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.     Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily inquiries from Japan and the United States.      "These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about and they don t know what to do with it. Some of that is ending up here with the attraction of high interest rates and reasonable currency stability, " National Australia Bank Ltd economist Brian Hamley said.      "There is a  flight to quality , " Hamley said.  "Australia may not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren t too many other countries where you d want to put your money. "     The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.      "We re looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S. Where some people would be concerned about the value of the U.S. Dollar, " Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said.  "Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap and the currency looks stable? "     But turning that capital into more permanent productive investment depends on government economic policy, he said.      "It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the direction in the economy, " Buttrose said, adding that offshore investors would carefully watch the government s promised tough economic statement on May 14.     While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.      "It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be delivered, if the statement wasn t considered tough enough, one might see a substantial outflow, " Buttrose said.     Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and stubborn current account deficit, analysts said.      "They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think they would like to leave the money here, " Buttrose said.     Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.     Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency policy when he said authorities could not take their  "eyes off the yen " because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.     Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar within the range of 100 to 103 yen.     Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.     Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into equities, particularly in the gold sector.     The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3 today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the same period.     The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese companies that have invested heavily in the United States in recent years turning their attention to undervalued real estate, particularly in the tourism field.     Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney s five-star Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs as indicative of the type of property being sought.      "They think they find good value real estate here which, with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of investment Australia needs, " Buttrose added.  REUTER &#3;',0
'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY Kuwait s oil-reliant and debt-ridden economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists say.     Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.     Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.     This was after taking into account inflation in consumer prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.     Factors depressing economic activity include the 6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait s doorstep, which threatens the emirate s vital oil export lifeline through the Gulf and has sapped business confidence.     But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive new debt settlement program was introduced.     The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.     The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer spending, thus generating an informal credit system.     Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are still owed by individuals and companies.     There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs) in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it will not allow any banks to go under.     The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether debtors have regular cash flows or not.     Banks  shareholders and depositors will have their rights guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector is the biggest after oil.     Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.     Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.     But strategic diversification into downstream operations in Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.     Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average 2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as crude.     Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent years and signs government spending on productive sectors will remain steady.     External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8 billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit Gulf.     Kuwait s petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.     But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these reserves may not be enough to prevent a  "real " budget deficit for the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.     In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary, revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct, doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.     This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some shortfall.     Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for economic growth this year or next.      "It depends on oil prices, " one said.  "This summer is important. "     Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the economy.     He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.  REUTER &#3;',0
'MALAYSIA MAY NOT MEET 1987 OIL PALM TARGET Malaysia is unlikely to meet its targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar 1987, oil palm growers told Reuters.     Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes, unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser and overstressed palms, they said.     The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World newsletter report that Malaysia s oil palm output is likely to drop sharply this year.     Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about 115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell more palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the industry, a leading grower told Reuters.     The country s palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes against about 800,000 last March, the growers said.     The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year due to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.     The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean, is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous 21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.     In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expected to enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oil output peaks.     They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow, with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees against 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reduction will not be felt for about another three years.

'SAN MIGUEL DEAL HIT BY MORE LAWSUITS A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) &lt;SANM.MN> to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources in the Philippine food and brewery company said.     A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC s outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former chairman of both SMC and UCPB.     Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF) and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.     Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB s plans to sell the shares to SMC were  "a serious breach of fiduciary duties. "     The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a government nominee on the company s board.     De los Angeles, who represents SMC s minority stockholders, asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by the company s board.     On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company s retained earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of dividends.     De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt to equity ratio. He quoted SMC s chief financial director Ramon del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.     In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.     De los Angeles  earlier complaint related to SMC assuming last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC s Hong Kong subsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares. The loan assumption was again ratified by last week s board meeting.     An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by April 15.

"Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the government s expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement of the controversy by April 15, " the statement added.     A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on Cojuangco s court petition, adding:  "Any statement coming from us might be interpreted as adversarial. "     Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United States citizen.     The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln  "A " shares, which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln  "B " shares which are available to foreign buyers.     SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by the &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.     The sale was aborted when Diaz s Presidential Commission on Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend announced last June.      "We have no objection to Soriano buying the  "B " shares, " Diaz told Reuters.  "But everything is on hold now. "     The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy would be resolved before the company s annual stockholders  meeting, scheduled for May 14.     San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in 1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of 700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.  REUTER &#3;',0
'RAIN BOOSTS CENTRAL QUEENSLAND SUGAR CANE CROP Good rains of one to four inches in the past 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in the Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland s central coast, an Australian Sugar Producers  Association spokesman said.     As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet season.     Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.     Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.     Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region and southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and some mills are forecasting record crops, he said.     Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled towards the end of May, he said.     The cane crush normally runs from June to December.  REUTER &#3;',0

'NICKEL PRICES UNLIKELY TO RISE MUCH - SHEARSON Nickel prices are unlikely to rise significantly from current levels unless further steps are taken to reduce production, Shearson Lehman Brothers said in its quarterly nickel market report.     The market had recovered slightly to around 1.72 dlrs a lb yesterday from its four year low of 1.55 dlrs in early January, due to the absence of Soviet nickel cathode deliveries, but Shearson sees Soviet shipments soon returning to last year s buoyant levels, which should ease current tightness.     Output reductions by producers will take effect later this year but are likely to be offset by increases elsewhere.     Shearson said the nickel market will be virtually in balance during 1987, with total non-Socialist world demand at 556,000 tonnes, compared with an estimated 544,000 tonnes in 1986, production at 505,000 tonnes (504,000) and imports from Socialist countries at 47,000 tonnes (50,000).     It forecast prices will edge higher during the year from a first quarter average of 1.67 dlrs a lb up to 1.77 dlrs in the last quarter. The year s average will be around 1.72 dlrs a lb compared with 1.76 dlrs in 1986, using London Metal Exchange cash metal prices in dollar terms and assuming an average 1987 sterling exchange rate of 1.55 dlrs.

'POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth.     In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here, Poehl said  "It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit. "     He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that route.     Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy, accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth.     He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament.     But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.     Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home.      "A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth, " he said.     Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors, including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.     But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy.     The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.      "For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary money supply. But we must be very careful, " he said.     He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan s trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as the United States.     Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries, saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated.     All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he said.      "This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the part of our American colleagues, " he said.     But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar s value could overshoot.  REUTER &#3;',0

Lammers, Queen s Commissioner for the province of Flevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up an agenda and procedures for meetings between the employers and unions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies.     Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 in protest at employers  proposals for 350 redundancies from the 4,000-strong workforce this year.     The strikes were called off by the main port union FNV on March 13 following an Amsterdam court s interim injunction against the redundancies on procedural grounds.     The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 but Zeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against the employers and they were therefore very likely to restart the complicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future.     Meanwhile, the dispute over a new work-practice agreement in the port s grain sector continued, with 30 maintenance workers on strike, although loading was not affected, a spokesman for Graan Elevator Mij, the largest employer in the sector, said.

'PROXMIRE OUTLINES INSIDER TRADING LEGISLATION Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.     Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers, Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.      "We are proposing legislation that would provide for more disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would insure that takeovers are properly financed, " he said.     Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within 10 days, Proxmire said.     In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the SEC.     Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts.     Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60 business days from the current 20 business days.     His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer.     To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced.     The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers.     Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.     He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the Federal Reserve s 50 pct margin requirements.     The bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.      "When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know about it, " Proxmire said.     Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all shareholders recieve equal treatment.     He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.     Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring.     He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this year.

Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt on February 22.     U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stop accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue, but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of  "the high potential of a continued suspension that would result in reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987.

'STOLTENBERG SEES MOVES TO STRENGTHEN PARIS ACCORD West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said today s meetings of major industrial countries would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on stabilizing foreign exchange rates.     Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.     But he declined to say what measures would be discussed ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later today.     Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre accord, had been underestimated.     Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major trading partners.      "There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord, " he said.  "We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do not want to discuss that here.     Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a  "slight firming " of the yen against the dollar.     And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell marks to support the dollar.      "The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market, " he said.     Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be accelerated as a way of stimulating growth.     Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its pledges for economic stimulation.      "And we will have to see if the United States is able to do what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit -- and get it through Congress, " he added.

'MEAD &lt;MEA> EXPECTS IMPROVED EARNINGS THIS YEAR Mead Corp said the outlook for its major paper markets looks strong for the second quarter and augurs well for its earnings in 1987.      "The generally strong outlook bodes well for significantly improved earnings this year, " Burnell Roberts, chairman and chief executive officer said.     Earlier, the company reported first quarter earnings of 34.2 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share, versus 20.3 mln dlrs, or 65 cts a share, in last year s first quarter.     In 1986 the company reported earnings from continuing operations of 109.3 mln dlrs, or 3.50 dlrs a share.     Mead said its first quarter benefitted from stronger market conditions and improved operations.      "The combination of capital improvement programs and more employee involvement has been paying off throughout our paper operations, " Roberts said.     He added that Mead s pulp and paperboard businesses are operating well as prices have improved and strong demand has placed most products in a sold-out position through the middle of the year.     Mead said sales of its unbleached coated paperboard was particularly strong, up 13 pct versus the first quarter 1986.  Reuter &#3;',0

'DUTCH SUGAR BEET PLANTING HALF FINISHED Roughly half of this year s expected 130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground, a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the Netherlands, told Reuters.     Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April 23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman added.      "It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the crop is off to a very good start, " he said.     Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600 hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar, substantially more than the country s combined  "A " and  "B " quota of 872,000 tonnes.     This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000 hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000 tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota  "C " sugar produced.     Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.  Reuter &#3;',0

'ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last week s increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said.     Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died.     That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the government s subsidy bill.     However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF.

'FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.     They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.     However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.     Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.     There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.     Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean.     However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.     Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.     The season s sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln.     Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.     Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.     Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously.     This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes.     Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last season s 3.85 mln.     Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April.     The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.     The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season s 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop.     The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln.     The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86.     The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available.     Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.  Reuter &#3;',1

The figure for male jobless rose by 2,000 in the month to 436,500 compared with 470,700 a year earlier. The figure for women was 256,500 at end-March against 256,100 a month earlier and 259,400 at end-March 1986.

'ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted.     This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.     Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.      "I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, " said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,  "There s no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. "     Analysts say the chemical industry s biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.     U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said.     Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history.     In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs.  "I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, " Oreffice said.     GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.     The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Pace s John Dosher.     Dosher said last year s fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports.     Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s.     Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts.     GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA>  has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.     But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.      "Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, " Dosher said.  "But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. " Some top chemical executives share the concern.      "The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, " GAF s Heyman cautioned.  "The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. "     Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.     Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Dupont s Conoco Inc s chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast.     The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products.      "This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, " Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually.     Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.  Reuter &#3;',0

'DOMINION CALLS BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> REPORT RUMOR &lt;Dominion Textile Inc> considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said.      "As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and we re not commenting on rumors, " spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query.      "All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, " he said.     Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment.     Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition.     Dufour said the company has been negotiating with  "many " U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them.     Burlington s stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer.     Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S.     The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.

'COCOA EXPORTERS EXPECTED TO LIMIT SALES Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance (CPA) said.     The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member CPA which began on Monday.     They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices.     Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon.     Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules.     The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise.      "The world s cocoa price at present is just not interesting, " commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer.     Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next year s harvest.     The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the world s number two producer, is in private hands. This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards.     The CPA includes the world s top three producers, Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.     The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.  Reuter &#3;',0

'J.P. MORGAN &lt;JPM> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, TRADING J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.     That decision, spurred by Brazil s suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarter s net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986.     Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period.     In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities.     Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgan s trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.     On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.     Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.     Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.     If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.     After the provision for loan losses, Morgan s allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.     It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.     Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter s end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.  Reuter &#3;',0

'BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS Storage problems with Brazil s record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.     Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this year s estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.     He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems.     Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop.     But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation s capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.     The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity.     Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation s grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space.     In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said.     Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops.     The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.  Reuter &#3;',1

In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data through Reuter services.      "Many other markets maintain restrictions, " he added.     Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that information restrictions protected their interests.     In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage to their own commercial information businesses.     He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect their state monopolies at the expense of other economic sectors.      "Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire economies are put at a competitive disadvantage, " he added.

Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S.     Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition.     A Dominion spokesman said Canada s largest textile producer has been negotiating with  "many " U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them.      "There have been acquisitions in this area. It s not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning they ve done, " said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon.     Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said.      "They ve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, " said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry.      "In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, " she said.      "You look at their record over the year, and I think they re poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, " Gormley said.      She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share.     Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels.     Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis.     Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.      "After Asher s (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people don t find him very credible anymore, " said one arbitrager.     Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesn t win the target company.     Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc.     The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington.

'JAPAN IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO AVERT TARIFFS Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports.     Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.     The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japan s failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.     They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers.     Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.     President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement.     In making the annoucement, Reagan said  "I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. "     Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan s semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues.     Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan s inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs.     About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.     Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.     Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.     He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan s decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITI s power to control Japanese traders.      "The United States has excessive expectations., " he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. "     He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.  Reuter &#3;',0

'HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts to extend world penetration.     Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.     Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe s leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986, said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.     The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S., Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe, where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.     Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.     Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El Aguila S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.     Heineken s Spanish activities should start yielding profit next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.     Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer into the closed West German market -- Europe s biggest beer market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken.  "We have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important point, " van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.      "The question is not if we want to penetrate the German market, but how we are to do it, " van Schaik said, adding that while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very regionalized.      Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most important beer growth markets in the long term.      He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.     Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total 1986 sales.     On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists have been looking at other possibilities.     To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which had sold successfully, Coebergh said.     Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were popular in Rwanda .  "This is a possibility, but we could not possibly achieve the Heineken flavor, " Coebergh said.     Chairman Heineken said the company s seven year efforts to penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.     But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken s market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western money.  Reuter &#3;',0

In the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs, or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs.     Winston Wallin, Medtronic chairman, said the company will improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line.     Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per share estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will have heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988.     He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its businesses and not in its dividends.  "Shareholders are better off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends or share repurchases, " he said.     Wallin said he sees Medtronic s share of the total worldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988, from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.     He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic products, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters and lasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will double that by 1995.     Wallin said,  "Our objective is to get a hold of new products and start building market share if we have to beg, borrow or steal to get into new markets. "     In the past, Medtronic s pacemakers have been plagued with a number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulators also have criticized the industry, citing quality problems and a needless overprescription of pacemakers.      "We have no knowledge of any major problems in our pacemakers or leads, " Wallin said.  "We intend to re-establish our company as the quality leader in the industry.

"We hope to have some safety provisions so that we won t have any major dilutions from an acquisition.

'SHOWBOAT &lt;SBO> TO TAKE CHARGE, SEES 3RD QTR LOSS Showboat Inc will take a charge of 19 to 20 mln dlrs pretax against results for the third quarter ended March 31, director and assistant to the president J. Kell Houssels III told Reuters.     He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses of its recently-opened Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat Hotel, Casino and Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarter and probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well.     But Houssels said Showboat s earnings for fiscal 1988 should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to the contribution of the new Atlantic City facility.     Showboat earned 1,753,000 dlrs in last year s third quarter.  For all of fiscal 1986 it earned 5,769,000 dlrs.     Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the Atlantic City hotel/casino, Showboat has had to start charging interest expenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facility directly against income rather than capitalizing the interest as it had been able to do previously.     Showboat opened the hotel during its third quarter and gaming began last Thursday on a regular basis after test gaming was completed earlier in the week.  Reuter &#3;',0
'SECURITY PACIFIC &lt;SPC> LOANS PUT ON NON-ACCRUAL Security Pacific Corp said it is placing medium and long-term loans to Brazil and Ecuador on a non-accrual basis as of March 31, a move that will reduce first quarter earnings by 7.2 mln dlrs, or nine cts per share, after taxes.     Despite the anticipated reduction to quarterly earnings, Security Pacific said it still expects to report first quarter earnings higher than the 88 mln dlrs, or 1.11 dlrs per share reported for the first quarter of 1986.     The bank holding company said the action affects 401 mln dlrs of loans to Brazil and 73 mln of loans to Ecuador.     Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt on February 20.     Ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billion dlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks since February.     In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest payments for the rest of the year because of an earthquake which halted the export of oil, which accounts for about 75 pct the country s export revenues.     In its announcement, Security Pacific said it will record interest income only as it is received in cash.     The company also said it believes that Brazil will reach an agreement with its banks and that interest payments will resume later in 1987.     The Brazilian negotiations resume on Friday in New York when Central Bank Governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a 90-day roll-over of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that matures on April 15.

'IRAQI TROOPS REPORTED PUSHING BACK IRANIANS Iraq said today its troops were pushing Iranian forces out of positions they had initially occupied when they launched a new offensive near the southern port of Basra early yesterday.     A High Command communique said Iraqi troops had won a significant victory and were continuing to advance.     Iraq said it had foiled a three-pronged thrust some 10 km (six miles) from Basra, but admitted the Iranians had occupied ground held by the Mohammed al-Qassem unit, one of three divisions attacked.     The communique said Iranian Revolutionary Guards were under assault from warplanes, helicopter gunships, heavy artillery and tanks.      "Our forces are continuing their advance until they purge the last foothold " occupied by the Iranians, it said.     (Iran said its troops had killed or wounded more than 4,000 Iraqis and were stabilising their new positions.)     The Baghdad communique said Iraqi planes also destroyed oil installations at Iran s southwestern Ahvaz field during a raid today. It denied an Iranian report that an Iraqi jet was shot down.

'UNION TEXAS OIL RESERVES DROPPED IN 1986 Union Texas Petroleum said its worldwide proved reserves fell to 511 mln barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 1986 from 555 mln barrels reported in 1985.     In its newly released annual report, Union Texas said it replaced about 71 pct of its production of 56 mln barrels of oil equivalent last year after taking into account the sale of 27 mln barrels of U.S. reserves.     Union Texas, the nation s largest independent oil and gas producer based on revenues, is a privately-held company owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co and Allied-Signal Inc &lt;ALD>.     The Houston-based company said it lost 57.5 mln dlrs on 1.26 billion dlrs in sales last year, compared to profits of 165 mln dlrs on 2.04 billion dlrs in sales in 1985.     Union Texas said it received an average of 13.35 dlrs per barrel for its international oil production and 2.99 dlrs per mcf for its foreign natural gas sales. The majority of the company s total energy production is in the United Kingdom, Indonesia and Pakistan.     In the United States, Union Texas said it completed evaluation work on its oil find in Alaska s Colville Delta area.      "Although significant oil reserves were confirmed, development of this discovery will not be economical without substantially higher prices, " the company said.     Union Texas said it planned to spend about 42 mln dlrs over the next two years to develop its Eugene Island Block 371 in the Gulf of Mexico.     In 1987, the company said it budgeted 178 mln dlrs for capital spending, less than half of the amount spent in 1985 and down from 199 mln dlrs budgeted last year. Union Texas also said it would seek acquisitions of oil and gas properties as well as petrochemical-related businesses.  Reuter &#3;',0
'UAL &lt;UAL> MAY RESPOND TO PILOTS TODAY UAL Inc may have a response this afternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its United Airlines unit, a UAL spokesman said.      "Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and we need to get a clarification out, " the spokesman said, adding that there was a  "50-50 " chance a statement would be released today.     The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for 2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.     Takeover speculation has driven UAL s stock for several weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also held discussions with its chairman.     The developer indicated in those talks that he took the position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.     Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2 mln shares.      "United has got to consider this proposal. I think the pilot s proposal is realistic. I don t exptect them to take it, but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL management, " said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.     Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a strategy to become a travel service company.     The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention on its airline.     UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.     But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100 dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe the stock is in play.     Market sources have said that although Trump attracted attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps throwing the company into the hands of another buyer.      "The first domino is you have an investor with a considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past, " said Pettee.      "What s interesting is the values are there. There s something for everybody, " he said.   Reuter &#3;',0

'FED S HELLER SAYS MONETARY GROWTH TO BE SLOWER Robert Heller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, said he expects  "more modest levels " of growth in the money supply this year.      "In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a most desireable development, " he said in a speech prepared for delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange, Calif.     A text was released in Washington.     He said the effect of lower inflation and financial deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.      "Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest levels, " Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed after mid-January.      "I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as well, " he added.     Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.      "The pricing behavior of American producers in response to price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial for our economic future, " he said.     Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising import prices would  "generalize the inflationary forces emanating from the foreign trade sector " and might not gain more market share for U.S. producers.      "A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be the result of such a behavior pattern, " Heller warned.     He said  "we at the Federal Reserve will have to be disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy. "      Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather than new taxes.      "The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in international markets, " Heller said.     He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.     A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with Canada  "would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American producers to compete more effectively in that country, " Heller said.

'U.S. MEAT, POULTRY INSPECTION CALLED FAULTY The U.S. meat and poultry inspection programs are incapable of protecting consumers from contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and consumers charged.      "The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated meat, " Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee.      "The American consumer has little reason to feel confident about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him today, " said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition Institute.      "Company management is less concerned about the risk to health than about raising plant output and company profits, " Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy and Poultry.     Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose violations of federal law, demonstrating a  "serious breakdown in the entire inspection system. "     Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being contaminated by  "intestines dragging in a water trough used to flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit, chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow their noses. "     Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture Department s Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended the government s program, calling it  "one of the most respected public health programs in the world. "     FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5 billion chicken and turkeys every year.     Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in the meat and poultry supply has increased.     He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time and much money to contain the growing problem.     Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.     The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20 years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.      "We certainly really have not found an effective means of turning this disease around, " said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)     The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for detecting microoganisms.     But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls would cost too much.      "Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and economical meat supply for consumers, " Stanley Emerling, executive vice president of the National Association of Meat Purveyors, said.     Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at certain plants  "voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor legal recourse. "     Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2.  Reuter &#3;',0

He said the first quarter results are in line with those expectations.     General Electric cited the strong results in TV network and station operations of the National Broadcasting Co, which was not part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason for its strong earnings.     It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was much higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipments than the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike.     Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year s first quarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion of RCA s aerospace and defense business, the company said.     In addition, consumer products revenues were up from last year, mainly because of including sales of RCA video products.     General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987. It added that there was a one-time gain of 281 mlns dlrs after taxes from an inventory accounting change.

'SOUTH KOREA CORN IMPORTS MAY INCREASE - USDA South Korea s purchase of about 2.4 mln tonnes of U.S. corn in the past six months -- close to double last year s total -- indicates that imports from the United States, as well as total imports are set for a dramatic jump, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.

During the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mln tonnes of U.S. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes.

"On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and, because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its part by moving rates down, " Wojnilower said in a report.

'DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT Financial analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next year s federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.     The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.     Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next year.          "In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit, " said Stanley Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.      "At best, it will have a small positive effect, " Collander said in an interview.     Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.     The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker has warned that a further fall in the dollar s value is fraught with danger.     Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.     In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels.     As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States agreed to cut its budget deficit.     The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.      "If you don t deal with the budget deficit, everything else you do is going to be counterproductive, " Volcker said in recent testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.     Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government s purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United States.     Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.     Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none.     But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were  not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets.      "There s no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the Fed s flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer is, it s not enough, " Silvia told Reuters.     The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government s most vexing and persistent problems.     The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this year s figure will be any lower, though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year s end.     In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget.     On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the 1986-1991 period by last year s Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law.     While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for next year s federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.      "For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the most you re going to get " out of Congress at the present time, said Touche Ross s Collander.  "To do something more than that would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult. "     Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.      "To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level, " he explained.  "Anything less than that will now look like a failure to Wall Street. "     The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year.     The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new  taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.  Reuter &#3;',0

'MORE AMERICAN BRANDS &lt;AMB> ACQUISITIONS SEEN American Brands Inc s 545 mln dlrs acquisition of National Distillers and Chemical Corp s liquor business is expected to be one of a series of acquisitions by the tobacco company, analysts said.       "They were very frustrated with their inability to get Chesebrough. They said they were looking for an acquisition. It doesn t surprise me that they came up with another one, " said Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch and Co.     American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billion dlrs bid for Chesebrough-Ponds Inc when Unilever N.V. agreed to buy the company. But since then, Wall Street has been speculating that American Brands would find another candidate to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco.      "This is just typical, " said George Thompson of Prudential-Bache securities.  "There s going to be more to come here. American Brands had to make an acquisition because tobacco is still a significant part of earnings. Their position is a little less favorable than Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds, " he said. cash flow from its low growth tobacco, but the tobacco business does require great amounts of capital expenditures. It can therefore use its funds to make acquisitions. Analysts said the National Distillers  spirits company, which makes Gilbey s gin and vodka, Old Grandad and Old Crow whiskey, is not quite the type of acquisition they envisioned.      "The distilled spirits business has been in a steady gradual decline for sometime, as has the tobacco business, " said Thompson.  REUTER... &#3;',0
'BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.     In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements.      "Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them, " he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.     Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods, services and investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends.     Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.      "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity, " Koehler said.     The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S. Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems.     The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect.      "Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term, " Koehler said.     A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand. In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should rise faster than GNP.      "In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986, " Koehler said.     If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..     But only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would Europe and Japan look for financial investment in the U.S.     When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.     Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates.     It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability, economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.     A strategy had to be designed that helped  "the safeguarding of non-inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions, " Koehler said.     Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set, because they were only testing points for the market, he said.     In order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.  REUTER &#3;',0

'JAPAN MINISTRY HAS NO COMMENT ON RICE TALKS REPORT The Agriculture Ministry declined comment on a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.      "We have no idea about the report and cannot comment, " a spokesman told Reuters.     Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources, said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its intentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for farm talks.     The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.     Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff Control Act.     Nihon Keizai said Japan s plan resulted from worries about mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is justified, it said.

'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY Japan s little-known Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force to be reckoned with, political analysts said.     MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S. And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians, they said.      "The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information, " said one diplomatic source.      "They are a potent political force, " the diplomatic source said.     But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts said.      "The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not so internationalized, " said Waseda University professor Mitsuru Uchida.  "Suddenly they re standing at the centre of the world community and in that sense, they re at a loss (as to) how to face the situation. "     Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with London over efforts by Britain s Cable and Wireless Plc to keep a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in Japan s lucrative overseas telephone business.     The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now monopolizes the business.     It has also opposed a major management role in the planned merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on the grounds that no such international precedent exists.     The ministry s stance has outraged both London, which has threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger plan is evidence of Japan s failure to honour pledges to open its telecommunications market.     Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan s car telephone and satellite communications market.     Much of MPT s new prominence stems from the growth of the sector it regulates.      "What has been happening is an important shift in the economy which makes the ministry a very important place, " said James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory Service Inc.     A decision to open the telecommunications industry to competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted rather than lessened MPT s authority, analysts said.      "With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto legal framework, " said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell Whitten.     Close links with the powerful political faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT s influence, the analysts said.      "Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance of MPT, " Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of the influential political group, he added.     The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the Postal Savings System, analysts said.     MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal Savings System s ability to offer slightly higher rates than banks, they said.     Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT s obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized the ministry as feudal.     Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.     But many of the ministry s actions are not unlike those of its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world including Britain, several analysts said.      "The United States is really the odd man out, " Abegglen said.  "For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable view, " he said.  REUTER &#3;',0
'G-7 ISSUES STATEMENT AFTER MEETING Following is the text of a statement by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting yesterday.     1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of seven major industrial countries met today.     They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of their heads of state or government.     The managing director of the International Monetary Fund also participated in the meeting.     2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting, and noted the progress achieved in implementing the undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.     They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.     In this connection they welcomed the proposals just announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan s economy through early implementation of a large supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.     The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.     3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.     In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation of the Louvre Agreement.

'GERMAN BANKERS  REMARKS REVIVE TALK OF RATE CUT Remarks by two leading central bankers sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in the West German three pct discount rate may be under discussion, currency dealers said.     Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows required cuts in interest rates.     Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was not making a forecast on interest rates, however.     Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar gained slight background support from the speculation.     But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80 pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate and let the strength of banks  demands set the allocation rate.     It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.     Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.      "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity. "     Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.

Lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of the company s common stock from 10 to five pesos.     He said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18 mln common shares of stock on the record date of September 15 1987.  "The exercise should make our stock more marketable, " Lazo said.

Official sources said the bank, France s sixth largest in terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,  planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad.

'EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE European currency markets reacted quietly to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to surprise that the markets should have expected so much.     The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.     Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining broadly entrenched in its current trading range.      "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84 marks, " said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.     However, she said the dollar could break out of the range with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S. Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.     Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen, possibly to 140 yen.     A Milan banker shared Stadelmann s view, saying he expects a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.     London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank operators to test the downside.     Concern that finance ministers and officials still in Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the near term, the traders said.     Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar s downward trend.     Traders in several centres said the market would look for fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to defend current ranges, which the communique said were  "broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting. "     Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said  "They re going to put somebody s resolve to the test soon. " The U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.     However, some dealers said London-based operators would be unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825 marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.     Chase Bank s Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme volatility seen in the first few months of this year.     One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the communique made clear the leading nations did not want a further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.     The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to 1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre accord s supposed currency target range.     A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were ready for a period of  "mainly sideways movement. "     But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique contributing to greater stability.      "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big boost, " said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks in the next three months.     A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and should not have produced disappointment.      "The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade policies to redress current imbalances are of a different timescale than currency markets operate on, " the source told Reuters,  "This is a political process which takes time. "     Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on currency markets today.  "Did people really expect a patent remedy? " he asked.     Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday s meeting was only the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully in the next few weeks for any changes in positions.     A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.     Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to support the Paris accord.

'GERMAN MONEY MARKET SPLIT ON LOWER RATE PROSPECTS Remarks by central bankers raised some hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a move in the near term, money market dealers said.     Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.     Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.     Dealers said the Bundesbank s latest liquidity allotment this week dashed some hopes of lower rates.     The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80 pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market, as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.     But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions, and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to 3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.     The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.     Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than the more public adjustment of leading rates.     The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.     Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the 15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.     Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week. This should then flow back into the market as it is deposited with banks.     Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5 billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday.     Holdings of average daily reserves over the first seven days of April stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above the estimated 51 billion required for all of April.  REUTER &#3;',0

'EC LAUNCHES ANTI-DUMPING PROBE ON JAPANESE CHIPS The European Community launched an investigation into allegations of dumping by Japanese semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark an intensification of world trade strains.     Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it imports into the U.S.     The EC Executive Commission said today the European Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.     Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in order to compete with the Japanese.     The Commission said it believed the Association had given sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found the complaints were justified.

'FINANCE MINISTERS AGREE ON NEED FOR STABILITY Finance ministers from seven major industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth.     In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to boost their economy.     West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it a  "good meeting " and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome.     Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened again to prevent the yen rising too quickly.     The communique said,  "The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances. "     It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan s ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the communique termed  "extraordinary and urgent measures " including an  "unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures. "     The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought together ministers and central bank governors of the seven major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.     The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the then-current levels.     In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at around postwar lows.     Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United States and European countries for its only modest efforts to open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its exports.     The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not elaborate.     It said the officials  "reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.

It added that revenues would have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.     Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly due to its life insurance business.     Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and higher personal risks.     Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.     In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change in accounting for U.S. Annuities.     AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal investment influences that it should be accounted differently from the more traditional insurances.     This change in accounting practice and another change to account for profits made on fixed interest investments, resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln guilders.     AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The Hague.     In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.     Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these costs and made only a small contribution to the group s profits.     AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill for Monumental Corp.     AEGON s net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December 1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.

'G-7 ISSUES STATEMENT AFTER MEETING Following is the text of a statement by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting yesterday.     1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of seven major industrial countries met today.     They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of their heads of state or government.     The managing director of the International Monetary Fund also participated in the meeting.     2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting, and noted the progress achieved in implementing the undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.     They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.     In this connection they welcomed the proposals just announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan s economy through early implementation of a large supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.     The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.     3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.     In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation of the Louvre Agreement.     They concluded that present and prospective progress in implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to foster the stability of exchange rates.

'G-7 WANTS TO SHOW MARKETS ITS RESOLVE - MIYAZAWA Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the market of their resolve.     At a news conference after today s G-7 meeting, Miyazawa said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a totally new statement was needed.     The speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he said.     He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the mark, had remained stable.     Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental.      "As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression of  current level  is rather vague idea, " he said.     The yen s movement in the past several weeks is within the range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.     It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market, Miyazawa said.     Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other major currencies largely have been stable.     He also said Japan s ruling Liberal Democratic Party has justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short period since the Paris agreement.     Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7 meeting and did not affect the currency talks.     The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago.

'YEN SEEN RISING AFTER G-7 COMMUNIQUE The yen is likely to start another uneven rise against the dollar and other major currencies because the Group of Seven communique contained nothing new, currency and bond analysts here said.      "Is that it? I was expecting something more than that, " said one trader at a major Wall Street securities company.     Marc Cohen of Republic National Bank of New York said:  "The market now has the impetus to drive the dollar lower again. "     The dollar hovered between 145.50 and 147 yen in the days just before the talks. Dealers restrained their underlying bearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday s meeting of the finance ministers and central bankers of the top seven industrialized nations in Washington.     After more than four hours of talks, the G-7 issued a communique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreement s view that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stability should be fostered around these levels.     The dollar sank to 144.75 yen in early Tokyo trading.      "They said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line with fundamentals when it was 154. Now they are saying it s in line when it s at 146. Will this still be so at 138 or 130?, " asked Republic s Cohen.     Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelled speculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities are prepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level is still inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February.     Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that the key psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of the authorities  permissible range.     Dealers and analysts warned that the dollar s decline would probably be uneven. They anticipated a concerted effort to prop up the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market intervention and public comments.     Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank of Japan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts of dollars. The dollar rebounded to about 145.20 yen.     The sources said the market may also be wary of agressively selling dollars for yen before Tuesday s February U.S. Trade data. The figures are expected to show a deficit of 13 billion dlrs, from a provisional 14.8 billion in January.     &#3;',0
'JAPAN BUSINESS LEADERS SAY G-7 ACCORD IS WORRYING The leaders of two of Japan s top business groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7) accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the yen s current level as appropriate.     Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), said the yen s present rate is well above adequate levels. He did not elaborate.     Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for Economic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yen from rising further.      "We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates as the yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord, " Ishihara said.     G-7 members Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany said in a statement they consider their currencies are now within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals.     Saito called on each G-7 member nation to prepare to intervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchange rates are stabilised at appropriate levels.  REUTER &#3;',0

'EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE European currency markets reacted quietly to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to surprise that the markets should have expected so much.     The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.     Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining broadly entrenched in its current trading range.      "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84 marks, " said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.     However, she said the dollar could break out of the range with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S. Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.     Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen, possibly to 140 yen.     A Milan banker shared Stadelmann s view, saying he expects a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.     London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank operators to test the downside.     Concern that finance ministers and officials still in Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the long term, the traders said.     Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar s downward trend.     Traders in several centres said the market would look for fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to defend current ranges, which the communique said were  "broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting. "     Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said  "They re going to put somebody s resolve to the test soon. " The U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.     However, some dealers said London-based operators would be unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825 marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.     Chase Bank s Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme volatility seen in the first few months of this year.     One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the communique made clear the leading nations did not want a further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.     The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to 1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre accord s supposed currency target range.     A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were ready for a period of  "mainly sideways movement. "     But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique contributing to greater stability.      "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big boost, " said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks in the next three months.

'FAO SEES LOWER GLOBAL WHEAT, GRAIN OUTPUT IN 1987 The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.     FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in 1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.     World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.      "Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially on the outcome of this year s harvests, " FAO said.     FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986 harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.     FAO s forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of substantial buying by China and the Soviet Union.  REUTER &#3;',0

'BUNDESBANK SEES NO CHANGE IN MONETARY COURSE The Bundesbank sees no current reason to change monetary course, vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in a telephone interview.     Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealers said, revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts may once again be under discussion.     Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his two central bank council colleagues.     But he added that the last central bank council meeting on April 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of  "subdued optimism, " particularly influenced by the news brought by several state central bank presidents.      "Much is going better than the impression gained by the public from the January figures, which have been in the meantime superseded, " he said.     German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after a decline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9 pct after they had been unchanged in December.     Bank economists said that the two together showed the economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter of 1987.     Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, a steady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark rate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMF meeting.     Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rates on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase tender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said,  "Since the central bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable. "     Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had moved away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of targetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have no comment on the subject while negotiations were still in progress in Washington.

'U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS The United States, which has long sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be satisfied Tokyo s latest package is a major development and allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement to stabilize currencies.     Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo s package, announced yesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.     But yesterday s statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yen s rise from around 153 to the dollar, the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.     And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though the countries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one point despite intervention by the Bank of Japan.     Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan s Finance Minister, said the movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.      "I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in Paris, " Miyazawa said yesterday.     The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of Miyazawa s departure for Washington, to attend yesterday s meetings of leading industrial nations.     In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action  "extraordinary and urgent ", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.     The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability.     The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the dollar s fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years. Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the Japanese announcement.     They also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term differences in past meetings.     West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of yesterday s statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.     Bonn s finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between West Germany and Japan s trade surpluses and America s trade deficit have already taken place.     No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of Paris.     European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.     A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would  "clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability, " he said.     Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.     Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.     Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts Tokyo s export drive to the United States, the Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.     The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.     Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.     The United States and France, backed by the International Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or  "norms " for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth, inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current account balances.     Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required.     But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.     The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the February meeting.     The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the relatively free currency markets of recent years.  Reuter &#3;',0

'GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS The global economy is expected to weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious poverty outlook, economic analysts said.     For finance ministers and central bankers attending this week s semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an additional concern.     The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.     In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to 2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.     For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product, another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0 pct from 3.5 pct last year.     The new figures are considered a major disappointment to the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope with growing mounds of debt.     IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.     Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.     Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier states for markets for their products as well as financial assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations   economies poses fundamental worries.     Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange, including the key one of exports.     The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion, has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only 2.3 pct, according to the IMF.     For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to ignite their economies but with little apparent success.     The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade deficit.     Reagan administration officials have been saying that the impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much slower than expected.     The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that  "it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years to get a resonably complete effect. "     The report added, however,  "the adjustments may take even more time on this occasion. " REUTER^M &#3;',0
'SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES The head of Spain s employers  federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried about the government s monetary policies because high real interest rates were hampering investment.     He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this year were not endangering the government s five pct inflation target. The government s perceived need to control inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.     High real interest rates were attracting an influx of speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the government s target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.     Spain s most closely-watched measure of money supply, liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17 pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.     To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from 11.8 at end-1986.     Cuevas said employers were heeding the government s call to hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year, with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.     These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.     He said Spain s current wave of strikes mainly affected the state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five pct wage ceiling.     Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in Spain s foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct increase over the corresponding period last year.     However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the peseta to correct the imbalance.  REUTER &#3;',0

'LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS Lead prices have risen this week against a background of a finely balanced physical sector, traders said.     Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buying or if labour problems develop in North America, they added.     London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant at a time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and prices tending to drift lower.     This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low level of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical demand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.     The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be felt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off, stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders said.     The lower supply levels result from a number of different factors around the globe.     Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries because of production and transport problems, lack of Spanish exports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz s smelter at Linares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have been drawing on LME stocks.     In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters  Port Pirie, South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks for maintenance. Although the company said it would meet commitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.     And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes per year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks and contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the U.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and a regular supplier to the world market.     Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks, have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.     On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up quite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported in the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the first two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying order was filled by merchants in March.     Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months delivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in Gothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often a target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.     On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp and Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each, and this is believed to be in strong hands.     Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest level since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses which are not popular with merchants putting together shipments.     But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since the start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies affected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on the transport of used batteries.     Labour negotiations in North America will play an important part in determining the direction of prices, with contracts expiring end-April at Cominco s Trail and Kimberley, B.C., Mine/smelter and at Doe Run s Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.     Noranda s New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract expiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.     Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting speculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current firmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium to 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg at midsession.  Reuter &#3;',0

Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87 due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological sub-divisions of the country.     The report gave the targets for various crops with estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following, in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).     Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.     The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84 respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4 mln.    India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year development plan ending March 31, 1990.     Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the 1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with good weather, the report said.      "The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water (irrigation) management.

Spain s trade deficit narrowed to 581 mln dlrs compared with 664 mln dlrs in January but the large increase in non-oil imports contributed to the substantial increase over the 159 mln dlr deficit registered in February 1986.

'VW SAYS 480 MLN MARKS MAXIMUM FOR CURRENCY LOSSES Losses for Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW spokesman said.     The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on 1986 business, despite the provision.     One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an  "upper limit. "     VW said in a statement following today s supervisory board meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing company.     VW has said computer programs were erased and documents were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign currency losses were not completed.     VW s former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having evaded justice.     Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985 profits. VW s group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares, which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.     VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5 billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985, since the new capital was in preference shares.     The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly less than three billion marks.  REUTER &#3;',0

'LAWSON SAYS SOME COUNTRIES COULD CUT RATES Nigel Lawson, Britain s Chancellor of the Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.     Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said central banks would continue to intervene  "as and when necessary. "     He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.     Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget speech to the British Parliament.      "If anything I m a little bit less concerned, but there is still a risk, " he said.     Asked if the United States should consider increasing interest rates to support the dollar, he said,  "If there is a need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn t need to be a rise in interest rates in the United States. "     Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday s meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in reducing its budget deficit.      "We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it continue year after year, " Lawson said.     The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention.     Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in the Louvre accord, he said,  "I don t think so. If there had been no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness. "     Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson said,  "the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode ... but one has to be vigilant. "     He said yesterday s G-7 statement, which affirmed that  "current levels " of exchange rates were appropriate, had been  "carefully worded. "  "We know what we mean, and we all mean the same thing, " he said.     Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of weakness for that agreement.     Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa s presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate domestic demand.     They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during the second half of this year.

'U.K. POTATO FUTURES TRADING NOT TO BE SUSPENDED Trading on the London potato futures market will not be suspended, Richard Harris, Chairman of the London Potato Futures Association (LPFA), said in a statement to floor members.     It was in response to strong representations by the Potato Marketing Board (PMB) complaining of a gross distortion of price which they say will result in large deliveries into the physical market when the April futures position expires.     The PMB had sought an immediate suspension in futures trading and asked the LPFA to take action to restore the relationship between futures and physicals.     Farmers and merchants have alleged a squeeze and cornering of the market but Harris pointed out that recent investigations by the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers (AFBD), the International Commodities Clearing House (ICCH) and other parties, found no evidence to substantiate this.     The main complaint from some sections of the physical market is what they say is an unrealistic futures premium over the PMB s average ex-farm price. April futures traded this morning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB s average price of 104 stg.     Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there is a two-tier market for physical potatoes. He said quality potatoes are in short supply and prepackers have been paying between 145 and 165 stg per tonne for best samples. But lesser quality grades have traded below 100 stg.     Some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be delivered against the April futures contract between now and the end of the month, and possibly disrupt the physical market.     Harris said the LPFA rule book allows the management committee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpractice and he assured the committee is monitoring the situation.  Reuter &#3;',0

'DOLLAR ENDS LOWER IN LACKLUSTRE FRANKFURT The dollar drifted down to end one pfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by the lack of concrete news from the Group of Seven meeting and comments on the edge of the Washington IMF/World Bank meeting.     Dealers said the communique early in the European morning from the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further attempts to push it lower through the day.     The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below yesterday s last 1.8365/75.     Koch said the assessment of the dollar s direction was based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated adherence to international agreements such as those set at the Plaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22.     Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7 as  "soft as wax.

Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added via Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next week. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocation at an unchanged 3.80 pct.     But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesinger said,  "since the central bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable. "     Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around 3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional 1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.     Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965 last night. The Swiss franc firmed slightly to 120.30/45 marks per 100 from 120.25/40, with the yen soaring however to 1.2570/90 marks per 100 from 1.2515/35 yesterday.     EMS currencies saw the French franc end unchanged from last night at 30.03/06 marks per 100, with the Belgian franc easing however to 4.829/831 marks per 100 from 4.831/833.  REUTER &#3;',0

'TALKING POINT/STEEL COMPANIES Steel stocks, which have had a healthy runup recently, still present some short term investment opportunities, according to some steel analysts.     But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm prices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end soon. They recommend taking profits.      "It s that time of year. This is strictly seasonal, " said Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co.  "Orders will be strong for about two months, and there are signs that some (order rates) are starting to dive already. "     But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees some short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp &lt;X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>, Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Inland Steel Industries Inc &lt;IAD>.      "There is still some attractiveness to steels over the short- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and rising prices, " Morrison said. He only recommends one stock, however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to make them more efficient.     Despite his bearishness, Merrill s Bradford continues to recommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.     Armco s steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance sheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford noted.  "It s not a high-quality investment situation yet but they ve come a long way, " he said.      "We think the stock will do moderately better than the market, " he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today, could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.     Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987, before special gains from recouped investment tax credits, against losses last year.     Armco s 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he said.     Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares.  "We had a buy on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have it, " he said.     The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said.  "But a lot depends on oil prices, " he added. About 60 pct of USX s sales come from oil and natural gas.     Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of Salomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX.  "The company s done a lot (of restructuring), more than the market s given them credit for, " she said.     She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was trading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a share this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in 1986.     Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has been recommending the stocks since last November.     Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group although he said the earnings outlook is improved through the third quarter.     But he sees potential trouble beyond then.  "I think (steel) prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer, " he said.     Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal dropoff later in the year.  "But there are more positives than negatives, " she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic industry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should cause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.

The report, dated April 7, said the reduction is based on an expected smaller harvest in the center-south region.     The center-south crop is now estimated at 550,000 tonnes -- 25,000 tonnes below the previous estimate.     Hot, dry weather during part of January and excessive rains in some areas in February reduced yield prospects and may have affected quality, the report said.

'U.S. TREASURY S BAKER SAYS RATE SHIFTS ORDERLY Treasury Secretary James Baker said that changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly and have improved the prospects for a reduction in external imbalances to more sustainable levels.     In remarks before the IMF s policy-making Interim Committee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the Plaza agreement 18 months ago have  "now brought currencies within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals. "     Baker said,  "These exchange rate shifts have generally been orderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of external imbalances to more sustainable levels. "     As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances  "simply are not sustainable, " Baker told the ministers.

"While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist, " he said.

The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about 20 to 24 pct of Brazil s total soybean crop.     It said generally favorable weather from early December through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.     However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the report said.     The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create serious storage problems, the report said.     Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are expected to be above average, it said.     Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop crop has been harvested.     During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the report said.     New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons for the decline are expected reduced government support price and good summer crop harvests.  Reuter &#3;',1

'U.S. MARCH RETAIL SALES CUT BY LATE EASTER U.S. retailers  lackluster March sales were due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect a recovery in April.      "Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, but underlying business is better than the numbers indicate, " said Bear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.      Analysts generally average the sales results of March and April to account for the variation of Easter s occurance. This year, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three weeks later than last year.     Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said sales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted 5.7 pct last year.      "The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate that the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear to be because liquidity and employment are rising, " said analyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.     Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in according to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986 s rise.      In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket items were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many analysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the holiday nears.      "Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a continuing strength in the housing market, " said Edward Brennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported an overall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women s sportswear were also excellent.      "Sears  total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April, " said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner.      J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH> were among the weaker performers with comparable stores sales declining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney s store and catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson s overall sales rose 4.8 pct.     Penney chairman William Howell said,  "Sales continued strong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed southwest. "      "Penney s been shifting away from leisure time activity wear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins, but are currently hurting sales, " said Greenstein of Bear Stearns.     Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for the decline. Edelman of Drexel said that  "Hudson had a tougher comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986. "     Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower than last year.      "Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are being kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales are coming through anyway, " said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.     Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to   be better than he had originally expected in the beginning of the year.

'DISEASE PUTS ZIMBABWE BEEF EXPORTS IN JEOPARDY Zimbabwe s beef exports to the European Community (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this year, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.     The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.     The outbreak in the country s main ranching province has already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairy industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export revenue.      "The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of beef exports, " one industry source said yesterday.      Commenting on EC policy, he explained,  "Depending on the seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are still awaiting their decision, " he added, asking not to be identified.     Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.     Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low prices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef sales could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.  Reuter &#3;',0

Traders said rumors, which began yesterday, added to speculation that the company would be the target of a takeover.     They said it was believed Coniston Partners and the Pritzker family of Chicago were buying the stock.     Coniston declined comment and the Pritzkers had no comment.     Traders said there was speculation a bidder might appear, and also that real estate developer Donald Trump, who holds a stake in UAL, might participate in a takeover bid. UAL pilots said they would be willing to pay 4.5 billion dlrs, which includes debt, for the company s United Airlines unit.  Reuter &#3;',0

'HOUSE PANEL WANTS PENTAGON MANAGE U.S. STOCKPILE The House Armed Services Committee has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled materials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.     The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.     The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill which will be voted on in the House next month.     The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a staff member of the committee told Reuters.      "They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being managed properly, " said the staffer.  "Management of the stockpile over the last 10 years has been atrocious. "     Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.     The staffer said under the measures passed by the committee the Secretary of Defense would have more influence over decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.     The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.     He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.     These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.     The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile management was counter-productive, he said.  Reuter &#3;',0
'CANADA TRADE RISE SEEN AS START OF RECOVERY Canada s trade picture has brightened considerably, underscoring economists  predictions the sector would post a long awaited recovery this year.     The federal government reported today that the monthly surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February, double January s 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than February 1986 s 189 mln dlr tally.      "Hopefully it s the beginning of a trend, " said Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.     Economists generally don t expect such large gains over the next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the year.      "We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the year, and it certainly looks as if this morning s figure is indicative of that, " commented economist James Donegan at the Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.     Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23 pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion dls in the month.      "Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of exports up by 5.9 pct in February, " the agency said in its monthly report.     Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85 billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.     Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year s dismal 10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion dlrs.     Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.     The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading.     Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy.     Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.     The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading.     Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy.     They say the country s consumers, who have been spending at a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into the country.     Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United States, by far the country s largest market, is expected to be strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.      "We maintain what s going to drive Canada s export performance is income growth in the U.S., " said Midland s Donegan.     But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and said it could be a mistake to read too much into February s trade upturn.     Jestin said,  "Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate that part of the strength (in Canada s trade figures) is probably transitory.

'HOUSE PANEL WANTS PENTAGON MANAGE U.S. STOCKPILE The House Armed Services Committee has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled materials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.     The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.     The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill which will be voted on in the House next month.     The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a staff member of the committee told Reuters.      "They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being managed properly, " said the staffer.  "Management of the stockpile over the last 10 years has been atrocious. "     Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.     The staffer said that under the measures passed by the committee the Secretary of Defense would have more influence over decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.     The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.     He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.     These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.     The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile management was counter-productive, he said.  Reuter &#3;',0

'SOVIET UNION TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 86/87-USDA The U.S. Agriculture Department increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet Union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.     In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last month.     USDA said the increased purchasing is  "somewhat surprising " because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.     All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn, USDA said.     Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12 mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.     USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.     The severe winter  "is believed to have resulted in above average winter-kill, " USDA said.     Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying grain recently.     USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.  Reuter &#3;',0
'DISNEY FAMILY MAKES BID FOR HOLLY SUGAR &lt;HLY> The Roy Disney family disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it made a bid to acquire Holly Sugar Corp for a package of cash and securities.     Shamrock Holdings of California Inc, a Disney family company, said it submitted the bid on April 8 to Salomon Brothers Inc, Holly Sugar s investment banker.     The offer was for 45 dlrs in cash, securities with a face value of 70 dlrs, and a  "contingent payment certificate " that would pay out as much as 70 dlrs over a 20-year period for each share of Holly Sugar outstanding.     The Disney family already holds 101,300 Holly Sugar shares or 9.0 pct of the total outstanding following purchases of 12,500 shares March 13-April 17, Shamrock told the SEC.     Shamrock said it had asked for certain information about Holly Sugar s financial condition but had been turned down. It said its offer was therefore subject to further discussions.      "Once we have had an opportunity to complete our due diligence evaluation of the company, including inspections of certain facilities and meetings with key management personnel, we would be prepared to negotiate all aspects of our proposal, including price, " it said in its April 8 letter.

'SONY CHAIRMAN FORECASTS LOWER PROFITS THIS YEAR Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> chairman Akio Morita said Sony s profits would be sharply down in 1987 as a result of the dollar s decline.
